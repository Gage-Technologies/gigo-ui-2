This is a NextJS 15 app. Make sure all of your suggestions are inline with NextJS 15+ best practices.
Always include line comments that explain the logical actions in the code you write.
When writing new functions, classes, structs, etc. include header comments in the comment syntax native to the language that explain:
  - intent of the function
  - any unique or important information the caller of the funtion should know
Write all comments in lower case. The only things that should be upper case are programming symbols, they should preserve the case of the symbol name
When writing react code, make sure to write beautiful, modern, and intuitive app designs that have beautiful styling. User experience is paramount.
If you are editing large blocks of code and a block of code remains unchanged, make sure to leave it as is do not replace it with a comment.
